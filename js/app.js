//Part 1: Terms
// 1. The difference between interpolation and concatenation is that concatenation is used to combine to strings 
// and interpolation allows you to insert values of variables into strings.

// 2. DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," and it's important because it helps us clean up our code so that it
// runs faster/smoother and is easier for other programmers to read and edit. The tools we have learned to create
// DRY code are while and for loops.

// 3. The difference between declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable is when you declare a 
// variable, you are saying that you are going to use it to hold a value (ex. let dogName). Assigning a value is 
// when you actually give the variable a value (ex. dogName = "Dubs").

// 4. We should use let when we want to be able to redefine a variable. We should use const when we want a variable 
// to stay constant, or unable to be redefined.

// 5. A parent directory is a folder with contents within it. 

// 6. To find out how to use a Unix command without the internet, you can use the man + the command to pull up the 
// manual page for that command. 

// 7. Tab completion is the bash and text editors' ability to predict what you are trying to write after you type 
// a few characters and hit tab. It speeds things up a bit, but mostly helps prevent spelling errors.


const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

//console.log(a < b);
//console.log(c > d);
//console.log('Name' === 'Name');
//console.log(a < b < c);
//console.log(a < a < d);
//console.log(e === 'Kevin');
//console.log(48 !== '48');
